`// Code can be poetry too! :-)`

This repository has all functional and non-functional *\#Codetry* compositions written in different programming languages for our social media accounts.

Note that these compositions are open source and all content can be used to share this new kind of art that combines the beauty of poetry with the syntax of popular coding languages. Feel free to add more content in a pull request if you are inspired!

## How to run functional \#Codetry?

### JavaScript

Poems are a simple function. All you have to do is copy the code, visit this [online tool](https://jsfiddle.net/), paste the code and run the poetry script to see the result. If you are on a desktop, you can follow the same steps but if you seek to experience the *developer way* of running #Codetry, after copying the code, all you have to do is press `F12`, go to the `Console` tab. Then paste the content and hit enter. Finally, you should see the result right away!
