`// Code can be poetry too! :-)`

This repository has all functional and non-functional *#Codetry* compositions written in different programming languages for our social media accounts.

Note that these compositions are open source and all content can be used to share this new kind of art that combines the beauty of poetry with the syntax of popular coding languages. Feel free to add more content in a pull request if you are inspired!

## How to run functional #Codetry?

#Codetry may be functional or non-functional. If you want to run a functional #CodetrySnippet, first check in what programming language it was written and then follow these instructions:

### JavaScript

Poems are a simple function. All you have to do is copy the code, visit this [online tool](https://playcode.io/javascript/), paste the poetry script and check the result in the `CONSOLE` section. If you are on a desktop, you can follow the same steps. However, if you seek to experience the *developer way* of running #Codetry, after copying the code, all you have to do is press `F12`, go to the `Console` tab. Then paste the content and hit `Enter`. Finally, you should see the result right away!
